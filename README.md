# Mini Project

In this project, you are tasked to create a program that automates searching for a word definition in a dictionary. Follow the instructions to implement.

Dictionary Project data is provided in data.json

    1. We should have a data source (data.json)

    2. Learn how to load json data into a python dictionary

    3. Create a function that returns a definition of a word

    4. Consider a condition that the entered word is not in a dictionary

    5. Consider input from user having different cases â€“ upper/ lower case or mixed eg: RAIN/rain/RaIN

    6. Make your dictionary program more intelligent incase users input a word with wrong spelling the program should be able to suggest the word that might be intended.

eg. pott instead of pot or rainn instead of rain. Tip: use difflib library here
